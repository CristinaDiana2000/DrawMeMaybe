[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:37 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findur_client_library.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "ur_client_library", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ur_client_library"
  with any of the following names:

    ur_client_libraryConfig.cmake
    ur_client_library-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ur_client_library" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "ur_client_library_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "ur_client_library" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
